# MP2494 DC-DC Converter

This repository contains the hardware design files for a **DC/DC Buck Converter** based on the **MP2494 Step-Down Regulator IC**. The design focuses on **Low EMI**, **High Efficiency**, and **Reliable PCB Layout Practices** to ensure stable operation. You will find resources such as datasheets, specifications, design considerations, schematics, layouts, and 3D previews of the board.  

## üìë Datasheet  

The MP2494 is a **monolithic step-down switch mode converter**. It delivers up to **2A continuous output current** across a wide input voltage range with excellent load and line regulation.  

- Features low EMI signature with controlled switching edges.  
- Built-in protections: **cycle-by-cycle current limiting** and **thermal shutdown**.  
- Requires only a few standard external components.  
- Available in **SOIC8** and **SOIC8E** packages.  

The MP2494 uses a **current-mode control architecture**:  
- At the start of a cycle, the switch turns on, connecting the inductor to the input supply.  
- The inductor current is sensed and compared with the Error Amplifier output.  
- When the sensed current exceeds the control threshold, the switch is turned off.  
- A Schottky diode carries inductor current during the off cycle.

## üõ†Ô∏è Design Considerations

When designing the PCB, follow these layout guidelines for stable operation and reduced EMI:

1. Place the **input capacitor** and **freewheel diode** on the same PCB layer as the IC and as close as possible to the IC pins.
2. Use **thermal vias** if necessary to improve heat dissipation.
3. Place the **inductor close to the IC**, but it does not need to be as close as the input capacitor. Keep copper area for the switching node minimal to reduce noise radiation.
4. Place the **output capacitor close to the inductor**.
5. Keep the **ground return path** away from noise-sensitive components.

Additional Notes:

* For mounting holes, GND connection depends on mechanical and shielding needs.
* Edge plating is not required for all boards but can help in high-current, EMI-sensitive designs.
* The EN pin can be tied to VIN (always-on) or controlled via a resistor divider (optional R7).

## üìå Notes

* Efficiency achieved: **~85.5%** (very good for this design).
* Mounting hole GND connection is optional, depending on mechanical and EMI needs.
* R7 is optional: if EN pin should be always active, tie directly to VIN.
* Edge plating is not mandatory unless your design requires **high shielding or structural robustness**.
